Question 4:
	K-means:

		Advantages:
			Converges faster
			More intuitive implementation
		Disadvantages:
			Worse performance at convergence
			In our example takes more time to reach the same quantization error
	Batch Neural Gas:

		Advanta﻿ges:﻿
			Better performance in terms of quantization error
			Faster at the same quantization error as K-means at convergence
		Disadvantages:
			Takes longer to converge
			More complex implementation
